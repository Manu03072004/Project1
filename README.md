# Project1
Predicting structural building damage during earthquake: Developed a machine learning model to predict the level of structural damage to buildings during earthquakes  based on various features such as construction type, occupancy, and year built. Built and trained a XGBoost algorithm to predict building damage and increase accuracy.
